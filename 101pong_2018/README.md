Pong , developed as an arcade game in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game.
It was inspired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on an oscilloscope.
The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakout game by the way. . . ).

Only one bat will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).
Bounces on the bat and ends of games will not be taken into account ; in other words,
only the ballâ€™s movement
will be considered, regardless of the context.

Your program must print:
- The velocity vector of the ball,
- The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time,
- The angle at which the ball will hit the bat (if it will indeed hit the bat, at anytime from t = 0).
